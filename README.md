Using a timer feature linked to the "Let's Play" button the time clock starts counting down from 60 seconds.  It will also begin playing the "Friends" T.V show theme music if you have your computers volume up! During that time the player is able to select one answer from each question to be their final answer.  

After the time runs out a result container shows how many questions you answered correctly and incorrectly.
