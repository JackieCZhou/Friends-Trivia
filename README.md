Game Layout:
Using a timer feature linked to the "Let's Play" button the time clock starts counting down from 1:00min.  During that time the player is able to select one answer from each question to be their final answer.  

After the time runs out a result container shows how many questions you answered correctly and incorrectly.

Languages Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript


Layout & Design: Bootstrap

The next steps of this project would be:
Add some more styling
Add a restart button 
Create different levels of difficulty, 
Add a real time updating leaderboard
Add a database of questions the game could randomly pull from to create a different series of questions each time.
Fix & Add media queries for smoother screen size transitions.
