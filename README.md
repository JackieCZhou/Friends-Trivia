# Trivia-Game
This game was designed using javascript, html, & css to create a functioning quiz game.
To run the game simply click the "Let's Play" button

Upon clicking "Lets play" the Friends theme music will play and a timer will count down for 1 minute while the user selects their answers for the questions.  
Once the timer has run out the user score appears at the bottom with their total correct and incorrect answers.

The visuals for the game were designed using bootstrap.
